# Buena Fiesta

_Buena means spanish great, so Fiesta is dead, long live Buena Fiesta!_

New generation of social network for helping international students - used by sections of Erasmus Student Network. ðŸ’œ
By volunteers, for volunteers.

## Authors

Created with love and patiently maintained by [@esnvutbrno](https://github.com/esnvutbrno) members.

## Usage

Buena Fiesta is based on Docker containers orchestrized by Docker Compose.

For running the project, you need `docker compose` plugin with running Docker daemon.

project, hit the `up` target: `make up`.
