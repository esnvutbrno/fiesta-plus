_Buena means spanish great, so Fiesta is dead, long live Buena Fiesta!_

New generation of social network for helping international students - used by sections of Erasmus Student Network. ðŸ’œ
By volunteers, for volunteers.

## Development

0. for local development is `docker`, `docker compose`, `make` needed

1. After cloning, prepare local `.env` file:
```shell
cp .env.template .env
```

2. Generate secret key for Django:
```shell
sed -ie "s/DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=$/DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=$(echo $RANDOM | md5sum | head -c 20)/" .env
```

If you want to run fiesta on other domain than `fiesta.test`, adjust the `ROOT_DOMAIN` variable.

3. Prepare Webpack dependencies:
```shell
make dc cmd="run webpack yarn"
```

4. Run database migrations:
```shell
make migrate
```

5. Prepare admin account
```shell
make da cmd=createsuperuser
```

6. Start the docker compose:
```shell
make up
```

You should see running Django:

```
buena-fiesta-web-1          | Django version 4.2.1, using settings 'fiesta.settings'
buena-fiesta-web-1          | Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
```

And webpack compiling the assets:

```
buena-fiesta-webpack-1      | asset main.22bd896b.js 1.37 MiB [emitted] [immutable] (name: main)
buena-fiesta-webpack-1      | asset main.22bd896b.css 316 KiB [emitted] [immutable] (name: main)
buena-fiesta-webpack-1      | Entrypoint main 1.68 MiB = main.22bd896b.css 316 KiB main.22bd896b.js 1.37 MiBÂ¨
...
buena-fiesta-webpack-1      | webpack 5.78.0 compiled successfully in 5852 ms
```

7. Make sure domain `fiesta.test` (or your preferred domain from step 2) is pointing to localhost or device IP (use `/etc/hosts`) and `webpack.fiesta.test` to load the project styles.
```
[local_host_ip] fiesta.test webpack.fiesta.test
```

8. Open `http://fiesta.test` and profit!

### Development tips:
* use `make generate-local-certs` if you want to HTTPS in local environment -- restart of containers is needed afterward
* Django and Webpack are watching the files via inotify, so no restart is needed after code changes
* if you accidentally kill some of the containers, you can resurrect them with `make upd` in another shell to have them up faster
* `make shell_plus` runs Django shell plus console, interactive tool with all Django models preloaded
* `make makemigrations` and `migrate` are you friends on your Django journey
* see [Demo Data Fixtures](#demo-data-fixtures) for some demo data to play with, or use `make seed` to generate some fake data (check the [seed command](./fiesta/apps/utils/management/commands/seed.py) for more info)
* `Makefile` included in project provides a few self-explanatory useful targets:

### Demo Data

For demo your can use included fixtures with the ESN Hawaii and some users to test it out. To load them run:

```shell
make loaddata fixture=fiesta/fiesta/fixtures/01_demo_admin.json
make loaddata fixture=fiesta/fiesta/fixtures/02_demo_section-universities.json
make loaddata fixture=fiesta/fiesta/fixtures/03_demo_users.json
make loaddata fixture=fiesta/fiesta/fixtures/04_demo_base-plugins.json
```

The single included section is `ESN Hawaii` with enabled two crucial plugins: Dashboard and ESN section plugin -- usually it runs ons `esnhawaii.fiesta.test`, so don't forget to add it to your `/etc/hosts` file.
It has the following users:

| username/password  | role                  |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| `admin`            | Django superuser      |
| `walter.white`     | section admin         |
| `anna.gunn`        | section editor        |
| `jesse.pinkman`    | section member        |
| `aaron.paul`       | section member        |
| `gus.fring`        | section international |
| `hector.salamanca` | section international |
